* Clean Pacemaker resources when an error occurs (usually during bootstrap)

Security
--------

Upgrades
--------
* You can now see the packages that changed between releases
* Ansible playbooks to upgrade from Debian Wheezy I.1.1.0 to I.1.2.0 on edeploy-roles/upgrade, this is the recommended upgrade method
* From now on upgrades will also be supported on RHEL7 platform so you will be able to upgrade from I.1.2.0 to I.1.3.0 on both Debian & Red Hat.
* We validated 1741 functional tests with Tempest
* DO NOT use the master branch going forward, use the release tag I.1.2.0

How Spinal Stack prevents it ?
------------------------------

To prevent OSSA-2014-041 on your deployed platforms, a user needs to set specific policies for Glance API via the glance_api_policies configuration setting in the environment file.

The needed policies are the following :

    'delete_image_location': 'role:admin'
    'get_image_location': 'role:admin'
    'set_image_location': 'role:admin'

By default, if the user does not specify any glance_api_policies in his configuration file, those parameters will be added automatically else the user will need to add them manually in addition of the policies she's adding.

Find below the snippet to use ::

    glance_api_policies:
      delete_image_location:
        key: delete_image_location
        value: 'role:admin'
      get_image_location:
        key: get_image_location
        value: 'role:admin'
      set_image_location:
        key: set_image_location
        value: 'role:admin'

To completely disable Glance API policies, set the following in your environment file ::

    glance_api_policies: false
